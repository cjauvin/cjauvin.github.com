Digital physics is the body of
mathematical and philosophical work treating the universe and the way it works
as a giant digital computer. This is often associated with cellular automata,
and names like Konrad Zuse, John Von Neumann, Stephen Wolfram, etc. What I find
fascinating about this field is that the models it suggests are making very deep
metaphysical claims: if they are true, it means that the underlying structure of
the world is much different than we think, and radically simpler in a sense.
Take the lattice gas
automaton for instance. A
version of it is an hexagonal cellular automata with very simple collision
rules, not more complicated than the famous Rule
30 or
110, for 1D cellular automata. The
impressive thing about it is that a simulation running this rule with many
particles can be shown to approximate the Navier-Stokes
equations, which
are the classical complicated mathematics to describe the dynamics of fluids.
Following Wolfram, I find it very appealing to consider the idea that the world
is not somehow running &ldquo;hidden mathematics&rdquo;, somewhere and somehow, to solve
some complicated equations in a seemingly magical way, but rather, that things
are radically simpler, in that the world is simply implementing a set of
trivially simple rules. The world is not concerned with, or made with
mathematics, mathematics just emerges, with inherent and irreducible complexity,
from extreme simplicity."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=https://cjauvin.github.io/posts/metaphysical-boldness/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.f49d66caae9ea0fd43f21f29e71a8d3e284517ed770f2aa86fa012953ad3c9ef.css integrity="sha256-9J1myq6eoP1D8h8p5xqNPihFF+13Dyqob6ASlTrTye8=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://cjauvin.github.io/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://cjauvin.github.io/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://cjauvin.github.io/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://cjauvin.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://cjauvin.github.io/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://cjauvin.github.io/posts/metaphysical-boldness/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><style>.first-entry.home-info{min-height:auto!important;margin:calc(var(--gap)/2)0 var(--gap)!important}.first-entry.home-info .entry-content{margin:8px 0!important}.first-entry.home-info .entry-footer{margin-top:8px!important}.social-icons a{padding:5px!important}.main{padding:calc(var(--gap)/2)var(--gap)!important}.center{text-align:center}.center img{display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto}</style><meta property="og:url" content="https://cjauvin.github.io/posts/metaphysical-boldness/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Christian Jauvin"><meta property="og:title" content="Metaphysical Boldness"><meta property="og:description" content="Some models of reality are bolder than others Digital physics is the body of mathematical and philosophical work treating the universe and the way it works as a giant digital computer.
