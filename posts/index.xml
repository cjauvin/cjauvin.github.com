&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker"&gt;Code Spell Checker&lt;/a&gt;, which has a bunch of dictionaries for many languuages (I use French).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sygene.auto-correct"&gt;Auto Correct&lt;/a&gt;, which is much more obscure extension (its code has not been updated for many years), which allows to automatically change a word to another
one, as I write, based on a list of entries managed in &lt;code&gt;.vscode/settings.json&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Voting as a way to surface the hidden reasons</title><link>https://cjauvin.github.io/posts/voting/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 11:43:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://cjauvin.github.io/posts/voting/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Imagine a situation where a majority effectively has a quiet veto over a change. Not because the status quo truly serves them, but because, for each individual person, it feels simpler to go along with it. Speaking up costs energy. It risks conflict. It can feel embarrassing, or socially unsafe. So something persists that does not really benefit the majority, and yet is still easier, moment by moment, to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Insurmountable Hans</title><link>https://cjauvin.github.io/posts/insurmountable-hans/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 13:51:53 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://cjauvin.github.io/posts/insurmountable-hans/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="or-the-era-of-turbocharged-goalpost-moving"&gt;Or.. the era of turbocharged goalpost moving&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ARC benchmark was designed by François Chollet to serve one goal : be
sufficiently difficult, demanding so that it cannot be &amp;ldquo;hacked&amp;rdquo; by some
&amp;ldquo;cheating&amp;rdquo; AI techniques, LLM or whatever. But it must do so in a rigorous,
systematic and simple to define way, it cannot be vague or ambiguous. It must be
(relatively) easy for a human, but hard for a program. And when I first looked
at it, I admired its simplicity and purity: the problems are simple but deep,
and it&amp;rsquo;s clear that for many of them, you need to grasp &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; that goes
beyond mere pattern recognition or superficial pattern matching. They seem to
require some seriously deeper thinking. And if, like me, you thought for a
minute about how you&amp;rsquo;d try to tackle them, in a programmatic way (ML or
otherwise), it was quite easy to become convinced, that this is quite a good
benchmark. And at first, what happened, on Kaggle, for instance, was exactly
that: nobody could get even remotely decent results, the problem set really felt
like a tough nut to crack. From there, the temptation was great, to suggest the
idea that whenever ARC would be cracked, AGI would have arrived!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Metaphysical Boldness</title><link>https://cjauvin.github.io/posts/metaphysical-boldness/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 21:02:33 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://cjauvin.github.io/posts/metaphysical-boldness/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="some-models-of-reality-are-bolder-than-others"&gt;Some models of reality are bolder than others&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_physics"&gt;Digital physics&lt;/a&gt; is the body of
mathematical and philosophical work treating the universe and the way it works
as a giant digital computer. This is often associated with cellular automata,
and names like Konrad Zuse, John Von Neumann, Stephen Wolfram, etc. What I find
fascinating about this field is that the models it suggests are making very deep
metaphysical claims: if they are true, it means that the underlying structure of
the world is much different than we think, and radically simpler in a sense.
Take the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_gas_automaton"&gt;lattice gas
automaton&lt;/a&gt; for instance. A
version of it is an hexagonal cellular automata with very simple collision
rules, not more complicated than the famous &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_30"&gt;Rule
30&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_110"&gt;110&lt;/a&gt;, for 1D cellular automata. The
impressive thing about it is that a simulation running this rule with many
particles can be shown to approximate the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations"&gt;Navier-Stokes
equations&lt;/a&gt;, which
are the classical complicated mathematics to describe the dynamics of fluids.
Following Wolfram, I find it very appealing to consider the idea that the world
is not somehow running &amp;ldquo;hidden mathematics&amp;rdquo;, somewhere and somehow, to solve
some complicated equations in a seemingly magical way, but rather, that things
are radically simpler, in that the world is simply implementing a set of
trivially simple rules. The world is not concerned with, or &lt;em&gt;made&lt;/em&gt; with
mathematics, mathematics just emerges, with inherent and irreducible complexity,
from extreme simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Manifesto: AI (as a term and field) should subsume CS</title><link>https://cjauvin.github.io/posts/cs-should-become-ai/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 10:19:39 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://cjauvin.github.io/posts/cs-should-become-ai/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="computer-science-as-a-term-should-simply-capitulate-and-give-way-to-ai"&gt;Computer Science as a term should simply capitulate and give way to AI&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In French the term &amp;ldquo;informatique&amp;rdquo; feels slightly better, as a label to describe the field, than &amp;ldquo;Computer Science&amp;rdquo; feels in English.
But this is a rare occurrence for French, because most of the other terms, like &amp;ldquo;technologie de l&amp;rsquo;information&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;science des données&amp;rdquo;,
feel awkward and far from their &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; cultural counterpart, the thing in itself that we do, when we do it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>We didn't get the AI failure modes that philosophy anticipated</title><link>https://cjauvin.github.io/posts/ai-failure-mode/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 10:22:14 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://cjauvin.github.io/posts/ai-failure-mode/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The original idea of AI, that we got mostly through science-fiction, and also a
little from the philosophy of mind and logic, imagined an entity that would
implement idealized and mechanical notions of thoughts, reasoning and logic.
Such an entity would of course know everything there is to know about such
topics, and its behavior would thus be rooted in them. Although this would mean
that the entity would generally behave in impressive and powerful ways, it was
also implicitly understood that sometimes this &amp;ldquo;perfection&amp;rdquo; would lead to
paradoxical behaviors and &amp;ldquo;errors&amp;rdquo;: the robot stuck in a circle in the Asimov
story is the quintessential example.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Render a markdown table to docx with pandoc</title><link>https://cjauvin.github.io/posts/render-markdown-table-to-docx-with-pandoc/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 18:01:52 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://cjauvin.github.io/posts/render-markdown-table-to-docx-with-pandoc/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Suppose you&amp;rsquo;re like me, in the middle of editing a Word document, and you realize that you&amp;rsquo;re fed up

time things will take, it&amp;rsquo;s always very hard to answer. It&amp;rsquo;s a very high
dimensional problem, and you have many degrees of freedom: how much should you
charge, should you do it per hour or not, if you use AI how should it be
factored in the efforts and time you report, what is the separation between the
stuff that you charge and the stuff for which you don&amp;rsquo;t charge, does asking
questions to your client to better understand the problem, on Slack in the
weekend, count as time or not? Facing these doubts, and if they forgo the route
of charging by the hour (which can be logistically quite painful, and can lead
to its own kind of bad outcomes) I guess that most people are quite happy to
fudge a rough number for a flat rate, do a couple of rounds of negotiation,
reach an agreement, and call it a day. They implicitly accept that the outcome
of this process can go both ways: either you estimated too low, and this way you
will lose something, or the contrary. And you hope that in the grand scheme of
things, things should average out in a reasonable way: either your loss, or
their loss, who cares in the end? But is is really working this way?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Ignore Your Check Engine Light at Your Own Peril</title><link>https://cjauvin.github.io/posts/check-engine-light/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Oct 2025 12:26:37 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://cjauvin.github.io/posts/check-engine-light/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Currently in my car I have the &amp;ldquo;check engine&amp;rdquo; light being on, but it&amp;rsquo;s ok,

tools for it. The central one is certainly &lt;a href="https://ankiweb.net"&gt;Anki&lt;/a&gt;, a spaced
repetition app to train memory. I&amp;rsquo;m creating my own never-ending deck of cards,
with different types of content, for different purposes. The most frequent type
of cards is grammar focused phrases (very rarely single words) coming sometimes
from my own daily life, but also very often directly from videos of the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PersianLearning"&gt;Persian
Learning&lt;/a&gt; YouTube channel, created by
Majid, a very talented and nice Persian teacher, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>An Excel-like editable data grid widget with Streamlit</title><link>https://cjauvin.github.io/posts/streamlit-editable-datatable-demo/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Sep 2025 10:39:07 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://cjauvin.github.io/posts/streamlit-editable-datatable-demo/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I recently spent a lot of time trying to come up with an interactive data grid
widget in &lt;a href="https://streamlit.io"&gt;Streamlit&lt;/a&gt;. It needed to be a bit like Excel:
the value you enter in a cell should trigger the recomputation of the value in
another cell. At first I assumed it would be relatively easy, but given the
powerful state management model at the heart of Streamlit, I found out that it
wasn&amp;rsquo;t. State management for UI programming remains a hard problem, no matter
what is the environment. The most difficult aspect of React programming, for
instance, is certainly state management. The user-driven asynchronous nature of
a UI makes it an inherently difficult problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>What if AI Had Come First?</title><link>https://cjauvin.github.io/posts/what-if-ai-had-come-first/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 20:11:18 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://cjauvin.github.io/posts/what-if-ai-had-come-first/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Imagine an alternate history in which AI, in the sense of our current
LLMs, had come first. This possibly means that things would have
looked much more like they did in the &lt;em&gt;2001: A Space Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; movie:
computers having a user interface so powerful that you don&amp;rsquo;t really
need anything else (apart from a set of fancy looking dashboards
maybe).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is not what we got. First we got something that looked quite
a bit like an idealized &amp;ldquo;command box&amp;rdquo; (not vocal though, but textual),
with which you could give instructions to the computer, almost as if
you were talking to it. But not quite. These instructions had to be
expressed in a &amp;ldquo;language&amp;rdquo; that the computer could understand, and of
course it was far from human natural language. Very close to that
command box was the notion of a written program that you could give to
the machine, and which would be executed as a kind of chain of
commands, in long form, with more elaborate logic and syntax.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>AI in the Enterprise (what do you really think will happen?)</title><link>https://cjauvin.github.io/posts/ai-in-the-enterprise/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 May 2025 13:26:46 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://cjauvin.github.io/posts/ai-in-the-enterprise/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a cottage industry of AI gurus who extol the virtues of being
open about the advent of AI in the enterprise. Don&amp;rsquo;t be shy about it,
AI is powerful enough as it is, and it can already help in the current
state of its evolution (mainly, powerful chatbots that have access to
certain &amp;ldquo;tools&amp;rdquo;, and vendor APIs with which to build some more
customized applications, backed by cloud LLMs).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>On Being Obsessive or Efficient</title><link>https://cjauvin.github.io/posts/on-being-obsessive-or-efficient/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 16:27:18 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://cjauvin.github.io/posts/on-being-obsessive-or-efficient/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I was recently thinking about a dimension of intelligence and the mind
that might have played a role in my school results of the past, and
also my taste for computer programming. When you are taking an exam,
careful management of your time might be a very good skill to possess,
in the sense that if you are stuck on a given hard question, it might
be preferable to rapidly switch on another one, with the goal of
maximizing your overall exam grade, rather than completeness. But for
some people, this, in itself, is difficult.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Conveying Math Intuition Is Hard</title><link>https://cjauvin.github.io/posts/conveying-math-intuition-is-hard/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 May 2025 09:24:33 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://cjauvin.github.io/posts/conveying-math-intuition-is-hard/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.3blue1brown.com/"&gt;3blue1brown&lt;/a&gt; recently felt the need to
