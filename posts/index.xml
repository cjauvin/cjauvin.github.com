that might have played a role in my school results of the past, and
also my taste for computer programming. When you are taking an exam,
careful management of your time might be a very good skill to possess,
in the sense that if you are stuck on a given hard question, it might
be preferable to rapidly switch on another one, with the goal of
maximizing your overall exam grade, rather than completeness. But for
some people, this, in itself, is difficult.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Conveying Math Intuition Is Hard</title><link>https://cjauvin.github.io/posts/conveying-math-intuition-is-hard/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 May 2025 09:24:33 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://cjauvin.github.io/posts/conveying-math-intuition-is-hard/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.3blue1brown.com/">3blue1brown&lt;/a> recently felt the need to
add a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dlsa9EBKDGI">supplementary video&lt;/a>
to its &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQWpF2Gb-gU">Grover&amp;rsquo;s algorithm introduction&lt;/a>.
Apparently, a lot of people have been confused by what I believe is
basically just the logical structure of the concept, or why this
algorithm is interesting and surprising in the first place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For someone who only knows about classical computing and a little
about algorithm complexity, the simplest way to get an intuition about
Grover&amp;rsquo;s algorithm might be to first consider this:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Extremely Quick Pacman-based OOP Primer</title><link>https://cjauvin.github.io/posts/quick-oop-primer-with-pacman/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jan 2024 18:08:40 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://cjauvin.github.io/posts/quick-oop-primer-with-pacman/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have a friend who wanted to have a quick idea about whether he
should use classes and objects for his project. Of course I told him
that it depends.. on many aspects. He says that he doesn&amp;rsquo;t really like
tutorials, so here I want to propose something more compact: the
skeleton of a Pacman game, just the most basic concepts, without any
bells and whistles (so of course not playable, although almost
runnable).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Il y a au moins quatre types de programme</title><link>https://cjauvin.github.io/posts/4-types-de-programme/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jan 2022 11:58:40 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://cjauvin.github.io/posts/4-types-de-programme/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
