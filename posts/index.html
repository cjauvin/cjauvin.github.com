It’s a very high dimensional problem, and you have many degrees of freedom: how much should you charge, should you do it per hour or not, if you use AI how should it be factored in the efforts and time you report, what is the separation between the stuff that you charge and the stuff for which you don’t charge, does asking questions to your client to better understand the problem, on Slack in the weekend, count as time or not? Facing these doubts, and if they forgo the route of charging by the hour (which can be logistically quite painful, and can lead to its own kind of bad outcomes) I guess that most people are quite happy to fudge a rough number for a flat rate, do a couple of rounds of negotiation, reach an agreement, and call it a day. They implicitly accept that the outcome of this process can go both ways: either you estimated too low, and this way you will lose something, or the contrary. And you hope that in the grand scheme of things, things should average out in a reasonable way: either your loss, or their loss, who cares in the end? But is is really working this way?

There is something I don’t like about this though: if there is a NEW problem appearing, I won’t know about it, because this check engine light has only one state, and now it’s being used.

The central one is certainly Anki, a spaced repetition app to train memory. I’m creating my own never-ending deck of cards, with different types of content, for different purposes. The most frequent type of cards is grammar focused phrases (very rarely single words) coming sometimes from my own daily life, but also very often directly from videos of the Persian Learning YouTube channel, created by Majid, a very talented and nice Persian teacher, in my opinion.

It needed to be a bit like Excel: the value you enter in a cell should trigger the recomputation of the value in another cell. At first I assumed it would be relatively easy, but given the powerful state management model at the heart of Streamlit, I found out that it wasn’t. State management for UI programming remains a hard problem, no matter what is the environment. The most difficult aspect of React programming, for instance, is certainly state management. The user-driven asynchronous nature of a UI makes it an inherently difficult problem.

This possibly means that things would have looked much more like they did in the 2001: A Space Odyssey movie: computers having a user interface so powerful that you don’t really need anything else (apart from a set of fancy looking dashboards maybe).
But this is not what we got. First we got something that looked quite a bit like an idealized “command box” (not vocal though, but textual), with which you could give instructions to the computer, almost as if you were talking to it. But not quite. These instructions had to be expressed in a “language” that the computer could understand, and of course it was far from human natural language. Very close to that command box was the notion of a written program that you could give to the machine, and which would be executed as a kind of chain of commands, in long form, with more elaborate logic and syntax.

When you are taking an exam, careful management of your time might be a very good skill to possess, in the sense that if you are stuck on a given hard question, it might be preferable to rapidly switch on another one, with the goal of maximizing your overall exam grade, rather than completeness. But for some people, this, in itself, is difficult.

For someone who only knows about classical computing and a little about algorithm complexity, the simplest way to get an intuition about Grover’s algorithm might be to first consider this:
