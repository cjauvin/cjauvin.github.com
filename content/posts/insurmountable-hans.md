# Or.. the era of turbocharged goalpost moving

![](/images/CleverHans.jpg)

The ARC benchmark was designed by François Chollet to serve one goal : be
sufficiently difficult, demanding so that it cannot be "hacked" by some
"cheating" AI techniques, LLM or whatever. But it must do so in a rigorous,
systematic and simple to define way, it cannot be vague or ambiguous. It must be
(relatively) easy for a human, but hard for a program. And when I first looked
at it, I admired its simplicity and purity: the problems are simple but deep,
and it's clear that for many of them, you need to grasp _something_ that goes
beyond mere pattern recognition or superficial pattern matching. They seem to
require some seriously deeper thinking. And if, like me, you thought for a
minute about how you'd try to tackle them, in a programmatic way (ML or
otherwise), it was quite easy to become convinced, that this is quite a good
benchmark. And at first, what happened, on Kaggle, for instance, was exactly
that: nobody could get even remotely decent results, the problem set really felt
like a tough nut to crack. From there, the temptation was great, to suggest the
idea that whenever ARC would be cracked, AGI would have arrived!

ARC was in 2019, before the LLM-fueled latest Cambrian explosion of AI. Now that
we've got ChatGPT and that it's so impressively intelligent, can we expect
better? At first sight it's not entirely clear, because, ChatGPT is adept at
manipulating words, and these problems are of another nature, they are meant to
operate more in other realms of reasoning, which are not necessarily connected
to language in a clear way. But ChatGPT is also a very good programmer so..
maybe? Whatever might be the conceptual or technical difficulties, people have
been trying even harder to solve ARC, recently, and now we've got the [ARC
Prize](https://arcprize.org/arc-agi), to up the ante. And lo and behold,
progress was made, and steadily! And it's impressive!

But now this (relative) success begs the question: what did we achieve exactly?
Are we closer to AGI? It's not clear, or at least it seems that the debate is not
ready to be settled soon.

So I'm asking the question: what could we logically conclude from this, the
observation that the speed at which the goalpost is moved, in AI, seems to
increase? And I would like to propose a radical answer, which I'd like to call
the "Insurmountable Hans" principle, in honor of [Clever
Hans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clever_Hans), the horse that learned to
talk, and that we could not ever take seriously. I submit that whatever AI
becomes or does, we will NEVER accept, in an anthropological way, that a machine
can be _really_ intelligent or behaving (or even just thinking) in a way that is
equivalent to humans. This will never be a question of definition or criteria,
it will just be a flat out anthropological refusal, to ever grant this ineffable
quality, to what we consider ultimately a _thing_. In this sense, the problem of
AGI is insurmountable, and the quest will never end.
