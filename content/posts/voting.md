Imagine a situation where the majority holds a kind of quiet veto over change. Not because the status quo truly serves them, but because, taken one person at a time, it feels easier to keep things as they are: less awkwardness, less risk, less responsibility. So an arrangement persists that benefits no one in the aggregate, yet survives because it is individually convenient to uphold.

Now picture someone who wants to change this, but who feels—socially, institutionally, psychologically—almost powerless. One natural impulse is to appeal to democracy: hold a vote. Let the majority decide.

But in such cases, the “powerless” reformer can reasonably expect the vote to fail. The silent majority may not be cruel; they may simply be timid, conflict-averse, embarrassed, or unwilling to stand out. The result is predictable: the progressive option that would benefit most people is rejected—not with loud opposition, but with quiet non-commitment.

Here’s the twist: what if the voting system included a rule that makes silence speak?

Suppose that refusing the progressive option—voting “no,” abstaining, or passively blocking—requires a reason. Not a slogan, not a checkbox, but a short explanation in one’s own words: Why, exactly, do you prefer to maintain this arrangement, even if it isn’t in your interest? The vote would still be a vote; it might still fail. But it would no longer fail in the dark.

Because the outcome would now come with something extra: an inventory of the underlying motives that usually remain implicit, dispersed, and deniable. You would obtain the collective rationale—the hidden logic of the veto.

And if you’re lucky, those reasons won’t be a single monolith. They’ll form a constellation: many different explanations, some unique, some repeated, some circling around the same few themes. At that point, the raw data is too messy for ordinary discussion; it collapses into noise, defensiveness, and endless anecdote.

So you introduce a mediator: a large language model—not as a judge, but as an instrument of pattern-recognition. The AI clusters the heterogeneous explanations, extracts the most recurrent threads, and returns a short list of the dominant reasons—two or three, perhaps—that genuinely drive the collective refusal.

What you end up with is a mechanism for moral visibility.

Even when democratic power isn’t enough to produce the desired change, the process produces something else of value: the public revelation of what the group is really protecting, fearing, avoiding, or rationalizing. In a sense, it compels a form of collective self-disclosure—sometimes even a collective admission of guilt, or at least an admission of the true underlying reason.

The status quo may persist. But it can no longer pretend to be innocent. And once a society is forced to name what it is doing—and why—it becomes harder to keep doing it without thought.

Prompt :
Suppose that you have an issue where the majority holds a silent veto on something, that is not benefitting the
majority, but still, individually, is easier to uphold. There are many things like this in society, at large.
Now suppose that someone with a desire to change things, but who feels relatively powerless, would want to hold
a vote, so that the issue is decided democratically. The powerless can reasonably expect that the issue of the vote
will be negative, because the silent majority will be shy or lack courage. But suppose that you had a rule to the
voting system, which forces you to give a reason, if you silently refuse to vote for the progressive solution, that
would benefit the majority. Then you obtain something in addition to the result of the vote: the real, underlying
collective reason. And if you are lucky, and you have enough people with a certain conscience, you will then obtain
a constellation of different reasons, but some of them will be clustered among a cloud of similar ideas. At this point,
normally, you could not do anything about it, but I propose a new mechanism, mediated by a LLM: you use an AI to cluster
the heterogenous reasons, and extract a list of the top two or three ones. So what you obtain with this is a kind of collective
admission of guilt, or at least the real underlying reason, while something not so good will perpetuate. It is a mechanism
to force the extraction of collective guilt, in a sense, to force something to reveal itself, even though the democratic
power of the voting process is not enough, you still obtain "something", in the end, which forces people to think and evaluate
their choice or decisions morally.
