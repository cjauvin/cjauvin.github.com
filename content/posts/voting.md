Imagine a situation where a majority effectively has a quiet veto over a change. Not because the status quo truly serves them, but because, for each individual person, it feels simpler to go along with it. Speaking up costs energy. It risks conflict. It can feel embarrassing, or socially unsafe. So something persists that does not really benefit the majority, and yet is still easier, moment by moment, to maintain.

Now picture someone who wants to change this but feels relatively powerless. A natural move is to appeal to democracy: hold a vote and let the majority decide. But in these cases the reformer can often predict the outcome. The “silent majority” may not be strongly opposed; they may just be shy, cautious, tired, or unwilling to be the first to stick their neck out. So the progressive option fails, and it fails quietly.

Here is the idea: what if the vote forced silence to explain itself?

Suppose the voting system includes a rule that you cannot simply block the progressive option without giving a reason. If you vote against it, abstain, or choose the option that keeps things as they are, you must write a short justification in your own words. The vote might still go the “wrong” way, but it would no longer be a black box. The decision would come attached to its real motives.

What you gain, then, is not only the outcome of the vote, but a picture of the underlying logic that normally stays hidden. You get the reasons people rarely say out loud, especially when they sense those reasons do not look good in public.

Of course, those reasons will be messy. They will be varied, emotional, sometimes contradictory. But they will also have patterns. Many will rhyme with each other. A few themes will appear again and again.

This is where an LLM can serve as a tool rather than an authority. It can take the pile of explanations, cluster them, and summarize the main recurring threads. Instead of a thousand fragmented excuses, you get the two or three most common reasons that are really carrying the collective refusal.

So even if the democratic vote is not strong enough to produce change, the process still produces something valuable: a forced disclosure of what the group is protecting, fearing, avoiding, or rationalizing. In the strongest cases, it becomes a kind of collective admission, not necessarily of evil intent, but of the true motivation beneath the comfortable surface.

The status quo may survive, but it loses the ability to pretend it has no reason. And once the reasons are named, people have to look at them. They have to decide whether they can live with them. That alone can shift the moral balance over time.

Prompt :
Suppose that you have an issue where the majority holds a silent veto on something, that is not benefitting the
majority, but still, individually, is easier to uphold. There are many things like this in society, at large.
Now suppose that someone with a desire to change things, but who feels relatively powerless, would want to hold
a vote, so that the issue is decided democratically. The powerless can reasonably expect that the issue of the vote
will be negative, because the silent majority will be shy or lack courage. But suppose that you had a rule to the
voting system, which forces you to give a reason, if you silently refuse to vote for the progressive solution, that
would benefit the majority. Then you obtain something in addition to the result of the vote: the real, underlying
collective reason. And if you are lucky, and you have enough people with a certain conscience, you will then obtain
a constellation of different reasons, but some of them will be clustered among a cloud of similar ideas. At this point,
normally, you could not do anything about it, but I propose a new mechanism, mediated by a LLM: you use an AI to cluster
the heterogenous reasons, and extract a list of the top two or three ones. So what you obtain with this is a kind of collective
admission of guilt, or at least the real underlying reason, while something not so good will perpetuate. It is a mechanism
to force the extraction of collective guilt, in a sense, to force something to reveal itself, even though the democratic
power of the voting process is not enough, you still obtain "something", in the end, which forces people to think and evaluate
their choice or decisions morally.
