# Some models of reality are bolder than others

[Digital physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_physics) is the body of
mathematical and philosophical work treating the universe and the way it works
as a giant digital computer. This is often associated with cellular automata,
and names like Konrad Zuse, John Von Neumann, Stephen Wolfram, etc. What I find
fascinating about this field is that the models it suggests are making very deep
metaphysical claims: if they are true, it means that the underlying structure of
the world is much different than we think, and radically simpler in a sense.
Take the [lattice gas
automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_gas_automaton) for instance. A
version of it is an hexagonal cellular automata with very simple collision
rules, not more complicated than the famous [Rule
30](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_30) or
[110](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_110), for 1D cellular automata. The
impressive thing about it is that a simulation running this rule with many
particles can be shown to approximate the [Navier-Stokes
equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations), which
are the classical complicated mathematics to describe the dynamics of fluids.
Following Wolfram, I find it very appealing to consider the idea that the world
is not somehow running "hidden mathematics", somewhere and somehow, to solve
some complicated equations in a seemingly magical way, but rather, that things
are radically simpler, in that the world is simply implementing a set of
trivially simple rules. The world is not concerned with, or _made_ with
mathematics, mathematics just emerges, with inherent and irreducible complexity,
from extreme simplicity.

In that sense, I find that the world of digital physics is much bolder,
metaphysically speaking, than many other parts of science, which often present
models for which it's clear, a priori, that they can have ultimately no
metaphysical bearing on the world. They work well logically, as a mathematical
explanation, they can yield useful predictions, but they do not tell us what the
world is and how it works, ultimately. Digital physics tells us, boldly: the
world is a giant computer, and all the marvelous things that it does can be
ultimately conceived as the results of computation.
