I am a computer scientist with a strong interest for a wide variety of
topics, ranging from web applications to scientific data processing
pipelines.

Here is a list of things I have done (and hence can maybe do again,
with some variation, for you):

## Internal Management App for a Wine Importing SME

I have built (and actively maintain) a customized internal management
app for a wine importing company:

* Manages customers, orders, inventory, suppliers, etc.
* Document generation and automation of all kinds (price lists, order forms, etc.)
* Visualization and dashboards

Under the hood of this application:

* Python and PostgreSQL backend
* Ext JS frontend (I'm currently experimenting with a React rewrite)
* Running on a Digital Ocean VPS

## Shopify Store

I have helped to build a Shopify-based music licensing store for a
client, which entailed to master their development tools and API.

## Road Address Correction Algorithm

I have created an algorithm to detect and correct errors in big road
address databases (mostly typos), and geocode the results. The same
kind of thing that Google Maps offers, only with a data pipeline over
which I (as well as my clients) have the entire control (including the
suite of open source tools and geographical data I have been
using). An
[article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1877584510000043)
has been published about this project.

## 3D Reconstruction of Botanical Trees from LIDAR Data

With researchers from a forestry lab, I have created a tool with an
innovative UI for the 3D reconstruction of botanical trees from LIDAR
scanning data. I have co-written a [scientific
article](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/14/3/4271) to describe this
project, for which the source code has also been made
[available](https://github.com/cjauvin/pypetree).
