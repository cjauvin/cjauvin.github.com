I am a computer scientist with a strong interest for a wide variety of
topics, ranging from web applications to data processing pipelines.

Here is a list of things I have done (and hence can maybe do again,
with some variation, for you):

## Internal Management App for a Wine Importing SME

I have built (and actively maintain) a customized internal management
app for a wine importing company:

* Manages customers, orders, inventory, suppliers, etc.
* Document generation and automation of all kinds (price lists, order forms, etc.)
* Visualization and dashboards

Under the hood of this application:

* Python and PostgreSQL backend
* ExtJS frontend (I'm currently experimenting with a React rewrite)
* Running on a Digital Ocean VPS

## Shopify Store

I have helped to build a Shopify Store, which entailed to master their
development tools and API.

## Road Address Correction Algorithm

I have created an algorithm to detect and correct errors in big road
address databases (mostly typos), and geocode the results. The same
kind of thing that Google Maps offers, only with a data pipeline over
which I (as well as my clients) have the entire control (including the
suite of open source tools and geographical data I have been using).

## 3D Reconstruction of Botanical Trees from LIDAR Data

For a forestry lab, I have created a tool with an innovative UI for
the 3D reconstruction of botanical trees from LIDAR scanning data.
