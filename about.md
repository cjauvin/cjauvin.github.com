I have been interested in computers and programming for _long_ time. I
have a MSc in Computer Science from University of Montreal, where I
studied Machine Learning with Yoshua Bengio.

I know a lot about programming, web development, databases and machine
learning.

There are a lot of tools that I _like_, but there are three that I
_love_: Emacs, Python and PostgreSQL.
